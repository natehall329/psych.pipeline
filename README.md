# `psych.pipeline`
simple and debuggable data analysis framework for working with human subjects data

note: current state of the package is broken, so get in touch if you are interested in pushing the package forward. I lost steam for this after working for a few weeks on it and would like to see a new debuggable workflow available.

**The package is currently a broken state but I do have plans to finish it up at some point in the next year**
