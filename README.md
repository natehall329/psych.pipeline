simple and debuggable data analysis framework for working with human subjects data

**The package is currently a broken state but I do have plans to finish it up at some point in the next few years. I am very interested in working with a small team that might be able to generate a very flexible processing framework that can be used across human subjects data analysis projects. I have many ideas but little time to implement them currently. In fact, there are probably some relatively substantial revisions that would need to happen to lay the groundwork for what I have in mind. If you are interested in collaborating on this I would love to hear from you!**
